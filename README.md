## Task1 

Read the paper and wrote a report of the technique (a model-based RL) which can be found in this repository, in a tutorial like fashion with complete instructions to recreate the Worldmodels.

## Task 2

For this task the results have been reproduced for the car racing environment. Adopted the repo https://github.com/pantelis-classes/world-models-latest.git. All the weight files, training history files and controller history files can be found in the respective directories.

## Task 3

The scripts used for the GAN files can be found in this repository.


# WorldModels
An implementation of the ideas from this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10122.pdf

Code base adapted from https://github.com/hardmaru/estool

For full installation and run instructions see this blog post:

# Building with Docker

See `Dockerfile.cpu` and `launch-docker-cpu.sh` or equivalent GPU files for instructions.
